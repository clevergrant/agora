# Main Ideas

- 2 possible interactions with a post:
	1. Show this to more people (open eye icon)
	2. Show this to less people (closed eye icon)
	- The idea is to copy what reddit did, but be a bit more transparent

- users can create their own content
	- files will be stored on a server for availability unless it's paid content
- users can buy staking coin to unlock content monetization
	- users can purchase other users' content peacemeal
	- users can also subscribe to this user's content
		- subscription is not a monthly fee, but an auto-purchase when the creator posts a new paid post
		- (this would mean that creators cannot choose how much their post is worth, as they could do a subscription scam)

- Main feed that is the same for everyone (keeps it simple)
	- you can filter the entire feed to select for specific subjects
	- paid content will still show up in feed behind a pay wall
